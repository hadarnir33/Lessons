# Private Lessons Code Repository

Welcome to the Private Lessons Code Repository! This project is a dedicated space for the code developed during our private lessons, organized by different branches, each representing a distinct data structure. As a student, you can use this repository to access and review code related to various data structures for practice and reinforcement.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/hadarnir33/Lessons.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Move into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd Lessons
     ```

3. **Explore and Practice:**
   - Each branch corresponds to a different data structure.
   - Switch to a specific branch to access code related to that data structure:
     ```bash
     git checkout branch_name
     ```
   - Review the code, experiment with modifications, and use it for practice.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute improvements, corrections, or additional examples for a specific data structure, feel free to submit pull requests to the corresponding branch. Collaboration is encouraged, making this repository a valuable resource for ongoing learning.

## Issues and Questions

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the code for a specific data structure, you can open an issue in the repository. This way, we can address concerns and provide clarification for the benefit of everyone.

Happy coding and enjoy your practice sessions!
